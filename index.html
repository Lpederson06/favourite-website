    <p>
      Chemistry is my favourite subject in school, as it fascinates me,
      especially Organic Chemistry, as it is very interesting to learn about
      alkanes, carboxylic acids, etc and learn how mainly carbon and hydrogen
      form so much of our organic world, like the methane shown above.

      My favourite animal is a dog, as they are very loyal and kind, which i
      think makes them the best pet to have (I also have two dogs so maybe i a
      little biased). and the picture above is of my dog Bane, he is a very
      sweet and goofy dog.

    <h2>Khaki Pants</h2>

    <p>I really like khaki pants, as khakis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are comfortabke</li>
      <li>Look nice</li>
      <li>Aren't fancy but also not too casual</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Khakis are my favourite type of pants, and I wear a pair almost everyday.

    <p>
      The Mercedes AMG GTR is a sleak and beautiful looking car with an
      intimidating face, and under its sleak appearance, it holds a monster 4.0L
      V8 engine which can get it from 0-100km/h in 3.2 seconds.
